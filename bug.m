In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between `retain` and `release` calls within methods that handle asynchronous operations or callbacks.  Consider this scenario: 

```objectivec
- (void)someAsyncOperation {
    MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    [self performSelector:@selector(processObject:) withObject:obj afterDelay:2.0];
}

- (void)processObject:(MyObject *)obj {
    // ... use obj ...
    [obj release]; // Potential bug here
}
```

The problem: If `someAsyncOperation` is called multiple times before `processObject:` gets a chance to execute for a previous call, the object `obj` may be released prematurely. By the time `processObject:` gets called, `obj` might already have been deallocated. This leads to a crash when trying to access `obj`.

This is especially dangerous because it's not immediately apparent from the code, often only surfacing under specific timing conditions.  The `afterDelay:` method's inherent asynchronous nature obscures the problem.

Another common error arises from improper handling of objects passed between threads.  If a thread allocates an object and another thread deallocates it without proper synchronization, it can lead to race conditions and crashes.
