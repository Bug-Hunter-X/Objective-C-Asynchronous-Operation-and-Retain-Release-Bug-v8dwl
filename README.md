# Objective-C Asynchronous Operation and Retain/Release Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Objective-C related to the handling of memory management in asynchronous operations.  The bug arises from the interaction between `retain` and `release` calls, leading to premature deallocation of objects and potential crashes.

The `bug.m` file showcases the buggy code, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version that addresses the memory management issues and ensures correct object lifetime.

The bug is particularly insidious because its effects are not always immediately visible, making it difficult to diagnose.  The asynchronous nature of the code obscures the timing-related issues causing the premature release.

This repository aims to highlight the importance of careful memory management, especially when working with asynchronous operations, callbacks, and threads in Objective-C.
