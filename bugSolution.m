To fix this, you must use techniques to ensure object lifetime is properly managed across asynchronous boundaries. Here's a safer approach using blocks and ARC:

```objectivec
- (void)someAsyncOperation {
    MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ 
        // ... use obj ...
        // ARC handles memory management here, obj is deallocated automatically 
    });
}
```

Using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) ensures proper object lifetime. The block retains `obj` automatically until the block's execution completes.  In modern Objective-C with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), the compiler handles memory management, making this approach much cleaner and safer.  Manual `retain` and `release` calls are not necessary in this case.

For situations without ARC or when working with non-ARC libraries, consider using `strong` properties and ensuring appropriate `retain` and `release` calls are balanced, possibly utilizing techniques like `@synchronized` for thread safety where needed.
